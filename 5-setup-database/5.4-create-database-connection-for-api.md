## Create Database Connection for API

Now that we have created our sqlalchemy database url and model, connecting our fastapi with our database is very simple.

Create a file called `main.py` inside `TodoApp`. Inside main, lets create our fastapi application like we normally do.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import models
from database import engine

app = FastAPI()

models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```

Run `main.py` by running:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

> Don't forget to activate your virtual environment.

After you run the file, you will see a file called `todos.db` inside TodoApp folder. That's our db which contains the columns we defined in our model.
