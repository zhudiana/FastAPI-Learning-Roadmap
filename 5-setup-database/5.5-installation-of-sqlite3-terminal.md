# Installing and Setting Up SQLite

### 1. Download SQLite

- Go to the official SQLite download page: [SQLite Tools for Windows](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
- Download the **zip file**: `sqlite-tools-win32-x64-xxxx.zip`

### 2. Extract the Files

- Unzip the downloaded file.
- Move the extracted folder to your **`C:\` drive** (e.g., `C:\sqlite`).

### 3. Add SQLite to Environment Variables

- Copy the location of the folder (e.g., `C:\sqlite`).
- Open **Environment Variables** in Windows:

  - `Win + R` → type `sysdm.cpl` → Advanced → Environment Variables.

- Edit the **Path** variable and add the copied folder path.
- Restart VS Code or your terminal so changes take effect.

### 4. Verify Installation

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
sqlite3 --version
```

If everything is set up correctly, you’ll see the installed version.

## Creating and Using the Database

### 1. Database Creation

In our FastAPI project, we already created the `todos.db` database file using:

```python
models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```

This generated a `todos.db` file inside the project folder.

### 2. Adding Data from the Terminal

Open your terminal inside the project folder and run:

```bash
sqlite3 todos.db
```

Now, you can insert data into your `todos` table with SQL queries. Example:

```sql
INSERT INTO todos (id, title, description) VALUES (1, "Buy milk", "Get it from the store", 5, False);
INSERT INTO todos (id, title, description) VALUES (2, "Learn FastAPI", "Work on the roadmap project", 3, False);
INSERT INTO todos (id, title, description) VALUES (3, "Exercise", "Go for a 30-minute run", 4, False);
```

Check the inserted values:

```sql
SELECT * FROM todos;
```

You should now see the three rows inside your `todos.db`.

### Next Steps

In the next section, we’ll connect our FastAPI endpoints to this database and build APIs to **read and return the data**.
