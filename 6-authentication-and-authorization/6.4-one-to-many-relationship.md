## One-to-Many Relationship

So far, our **Todo** app has a `todos` table with the following columns:

- `id`
- `title`
- `description`
- `priority`
- `complete`

Now that we’re adding **authentication**, we’ll also create a `users` table with the following columns:

- `id`
- `email`
- `username`
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `hashed_password`
- `is_active`

### Why Do We Need a Relationship?

We want each **user** to have their own todos.

- One user can have **multiple todos**.
- But each todo belongs to **exactly one user**.

This type of relationship is called a **one-to-many relationship**.

### What is a Foreign Key?

- A **foreign key** is a column in one table that points to the **primary key** in another table.
- In our case:

  - The `users.id` column will be the primary key for the `users` table.
  - The `todos` table will have an `owner_id` column, which is a **foreign key** referencing `users.id`.
