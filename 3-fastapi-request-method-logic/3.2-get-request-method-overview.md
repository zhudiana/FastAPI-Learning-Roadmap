## GET HTTP Request Method

Create a file called movies.py and add the following to your file.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

MOVIES = [
    {"title": "Inception", "director": "Christopher Nolan", "genre": "Sci-Fi"},
    {"title": "The Godfather", "director": "Francis Ford Coppola", "genre": "Crime"},
    {"title": "Spirited Away", "director": "Hayao Miyazaki", "genre": "Animation"},
    {"title": "Parasite", "director": "Bong Joon-ho", "genre": "Thriller"},
    {"title": "Pulp Fiction", "director": "Quentin Tarantino", "genre": "Drama"},
]

@app.get("/movies")
def read_all_movies():
    return MOVIES
```

> We have now an api endpoint called `/movies` which will return the list of movies of every movie we currently have.

Run the file using the following command and go to the url http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies

```bash
uvicorn movies:app --reload
```

Since we are running with --reload, the server restarts automatically when we save changes, so we just refresh the browser without rerunning the app.

> Make sure you are in your [virtual environment](https://github.com/zhudiana/FastAPI-Learning-Roadmap/blob/main/1-python-fundamentals/1.6-virtual-environments.md).

FastAPI has something called `SwaggerUI` that will allow us to see all of our API endpoints, we will be able to call them and see the response of each API endpoints.

Go to the the url http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs and you will be able to see your GET request. Expand the endpoint, click _Try it out_ and click the _execute_ button. Now you can see the reponse of your fastapi application, which is a list of movies.
