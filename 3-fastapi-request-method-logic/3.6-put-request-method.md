## PUT HTTP Request Method

The `PUT` request method is used to update data. `PUT` can have a body that has additional information that `GET` does not have.

An example of a body for a `PUT` is exactly like the body of a `POST`. But we are going to be able to change the genre or the director of the movie in our MOVIES list by looking at the title of the movie we want to update.

Example of a Body:

```
 {"title": "Inception", "director": "Christopher Nolan", "genre": "Sci-Fi"}
```

Let's update a movie in our MOVIES list.

```python
from fastapi import Body, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.put("/movies/update_movie")
def update_movie(updated_movie=Body()):
    for i in range(len(MOVIES)):
        if MOVIES[i].get("title").casefold() == updated_movie.get("title").casefold():
            MOVIES[i] = updated_movie
```

In this endpoint, we take the movie data from the request body, search through the `MOVIES` list for a movie with the same title, and if found, replace the old movie data with the new one provided.
