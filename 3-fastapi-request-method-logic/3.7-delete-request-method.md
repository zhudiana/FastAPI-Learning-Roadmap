## DELETE HTTP Request Method

The `DELETE` request method is used to delete data. In the same manner as PUT request, we will delete a movie from the MOVIES list by searching with title.

The request URL could be:

`http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/delete_movie/{title}`

```python

@app.delete("/movies/delete_movie/{title}")
def delete_movie(title: str):
    for i in range(len(MOVIES)):
        if MOVIES[i].get("title").casefold() == title.casefold():
            MOVIES.pop(i)
            break
```

In the Swagger UI, if you add a title in the request body and execute, it will delete the movie with that specific title.
