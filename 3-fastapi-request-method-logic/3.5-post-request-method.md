## POST HTTP Request Method

The `POST` request method is used to create data to the server. `POST` can have a body that has additional information that `GET` does not have.

Post request has an additional area to be able to send data called `the body`. You can send data in the body that can be used by fastAPI. GET request can not have a body.

We have to first import `Body` in our file.

Let's add new movie to our MOVIES list.

```python
from fastapi import Body, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/movies/create_movie")
def create_movie(new_movie=Body()):
    MOVIES.append(new_movie)
```

In the swagger ui, after you refresh the browser, you will see the the post request listed. Add a movie name, director and genre in the request body in the following format:

```JSON
{
    "title": "Interstellar",
    "director": "Christopher Nolan",
    "genre": "Sci-Fi"
}
```

Now, if you run the get request to list all the movies, you will see the new movie added to the list.
