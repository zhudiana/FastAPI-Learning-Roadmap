## Production DBMS (Database Management System)

In the following sections, we will be installing a production relational database to our application. The two DBMS applications we will be going over is **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**. Both DBMS applications are used widely throughout enterprise applications.

Let's see the difference between _SQLite_ and _production DBMS_.

### SQLite vs Production DBMS

#### 1. SQLite

- It provides _local data storage_ for individual applications and devices.

- It is easy, effiecient and simple to start with.

- It works perfectly for small/medium applications with small number of users.

- It runs in-memory or local disk, which makes development to be easy.

- You can deploy a SQLite3 database along with the application.

#### 2. Production DBMS (MySQL & PostgreSQL)

- These production DBMS focuses on _scalability_, _concurrency_ and _control_.

- If your aoolication is going to have many users, it is wise to switch to a production DBMS.

- Production DBMS run on their own server and port. Which means you need to make sure the databse is running , and have authentication linking to the DBMS.

- For deployment, you need to deploy the database separate from the application.

In the next sections, we will do the following:

- Install the production DBMS

- Setup the tables and data within the production DBMS

- Connect the production DBMS to our application

- Push data from application to our production DBMS.
