## Delete a Movie

Let's create an endpoint that deletes a movie.

```python
@app.delete("/movies/{movie_id}")
def delete_movies(movie_id: int):
    for i in range(len(MOVIES)):
        if MOVIES[i].id == movie_id:
            MOVIES.pop(i)
            break
```

We can now delete a movie with a specific movie id.

---

Let's do one more exercise on this one. Let's add a new field to `Movie` and `MovieRequest` called `released_year: int` (Eg., released_year: int = 2010).

- We will enhance each `Movie` to have a `released_year`.

- Then, we will create a new `GET` request method to filter by `released_year`.

```python
class Movie:
    id: int
    title: str
    director: str
    genre: str
    rating: int
    released_year: int     # add released_year here

                                                    # add released_year here
    def __init__(self, id, title, director, genre, rating, released_year):
        self.id = id
        self.title = title
        self.director = director
        self.genre = genre
        self.rating = rating
        self.released_year = released_year    # add released_year here


class MovieRequest(BaseModel):
    id: Optional[int] = Field(description="ID is not needed on create", default=None)
    title: str = Field(min_length=10)
    director: str = Field(min_length=15)
    genre: str = Field(min_length=1, max_length=10)
    rating: float = Field(gt=-1, lt=6)
    released_year: int = Field(gt=1980, lt=2025)    # add released_year here

    model_config = {
    "json_schema_extra":{
        "example": {
            "title": "A new movie",
            "director": "A movie director",
            "genre" : "Comedy",
            "rating": 5,
            "released_date": 2020,              # add released_year here
        }
    }
 }


@app.get("/movies/released_year/")
def read_movie_by_released_year(released_date: int):
    movie_to_return = []
    for movie in MOVIES:
        if movie.released_year == released_date:
            movie_to_return.append(movie)
    return movie_to_return
```

Do not forget to add the year when you pass values in the MOVIES() as well.
