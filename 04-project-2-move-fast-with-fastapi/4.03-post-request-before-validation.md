## POST Request Before Validation

Let's add a POST request in our Movies 2 project. Don't forget to import Body at the top.

```python
from fastapi import Body, FastAPI

@app.post("/create-movie")
def create_movie(movie_request=Body()):
    MOVIES.append(movie_request)
```

Add the following movie:

```JSON
 {
    "id": 6,
    "title": "Titanic",
    "director": "James Cameron",
    "genre": "Drama",
    "rating": 4.8
  }
```

After you execute the `POST` request and run the `GET` request to list all the movies, you will see the new added movie at the end with `id` 6. Since we are not using database yet, it is temporary.

If you execute the same JSON again, you will see the same movie being repeated. If you add a rating of 999, it will work perfectly. We don't want that. We want some sort of validation so that `id` is unique and other properties of a movie set to a valid value. We will be seeing data validation in the next section.
