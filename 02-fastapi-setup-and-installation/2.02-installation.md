## Installation

Create and activate a [virtual environment](https://github.com/zhudiana/FastAPI-Learning-Roadmap/blob/main/1-python-fundamentals/1.6-virtual-environments.md) and then install FastAPI:

```bash
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
```

> This will install FastAPI plus its recommended dependencies (like uvicorn, pydantic, python-multipart, etc.) in one go, so you donâ€™t have to install them one by one.

Create a file called main.py

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World!"}
```

Run the server with:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

When you run it, you will see something like `Server started at http://127.0.0.1:8000` and `server Documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`. When you open the url http://127.0.0.1:8000, you will see the following JSON response on your browser:

```json
{ "Hello": "World!" }
```

> We already created an API that receives HTTP requests in the path `/`.

FastAPI auto-generates **Swagger UI** and **ReDoc** for every api you build. You can use:

- The interactive Swagger UI (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`) where you can try out API calls directly from your browser.

- ReDoc (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`), cleaner and read-only documentation.
