## Pytest Objects

With pytest, we can test Python classes and reuse objects efficiently using **fixtures**.

### Example Class

```python
import pytest

class Student:
    def __init__(self, first_name: str, last_name: str, major: str, years: int):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.major = major
        self.years = years
```

### ❌ Without Fixtures (repetition)

If we had to test this class, we would need to create a new object in every test:

```python
def test_person_initialization():
    p = Student('John', 'Doe', 'Computer Science', 3)
    assert p.first_name == 'John', 'First name should be John'
    assert p.last_name == 'Doe', 'Last name should be Doe'
    assert p.major == 'Computer Science'
    assert p.years == 3
```

- This works, but if many tests need the same student, we’ll repeat `Student(...)` everywhere.

### ✅ With Fixtures (reusable)

Pytest fixtures allow us to reuse objects across multiple tests.

```python
@pytest.fixture
def default_employee():
    return Student('John', 'Doe', 'Computer Science', 3)
```

Now instead of manually creating the student, we can pass the fixture as a parameter:

```python
def test_person_initialization(default_employee):
    assert default_employee.first_name == 'John', 'First name should be John'
    assert default_employee.last_name == 'Doe', 'Last name should be Doe'
    assert default_employee.major == 'Computer Science'
    assert default_employee.years == 3
```

### Key Idea

- Without fixtures → each test creates its own objects (repetition).
- With fixtures → define once, reuse across many tests.
- Pytest automatically **injects the fixture** into the test function.

This makes tests **cleaner, DRYer, and easier to maintain**.
