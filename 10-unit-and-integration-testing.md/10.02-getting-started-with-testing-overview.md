## Getting Started with Testing

### First step

- Create a new directory on our project called `test`.

- Inside our test directory, create a new file called `__init__.py`.

- Inside our test directory, create another file called `test_example.py`.

### **`test_example.py`**

- Pytest will run all tests automatically that sit within files that have the name '**test'** in them.

- For our demo, all tests will be in `test_example.py` so Pytest can find them easily.

- When we write tests for our application, we will create new tests from a new file that matches naming convention of project.

- **Example**: `todos.py` will be tested by `test_todos.py`

### Create our First Unit Test

- Write our first assertion test.

  - Assertion = Statement that checks if a condition is true.

  - If condition is true = test passes.

  - If condition is false = test fails.

```python
#test_example.py
def test_equal_or_not_equal():
    assert 3 == 3
```

In the terminal we write `pytest` to test our assertion.

```shell
pytest
```

In this case, since the condition is true, the test will pass.

```python
#test_example.py
def test_equal_or_not_equal():      # fail
    assert 3 == 3   # pass
    assert 3 == 2   # fail
    assert 3 != 1   # pass
    assert 3 != 3   # fail
```
