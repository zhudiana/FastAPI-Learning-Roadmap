## Alembic Installation and Setup

In this section, we will install and set up **Alembic** for database migrations in our project.

### Step 1: Install Alembic

Go to your project folder (inside your virtual environment) and install Alembic:

```bash
pip install alembic
```

### Step 2: Initialize Alembic

Run the following command:

```bash
alembic init alembic
```

- This will create a new **`alembic`** folder inside your project.
- All migration versions (upgrade and downgrade scripts) will be stored in this folder.

- Alembic is now installed and ready to manage your database migrations.
