## Alembic

- Alembic is a lightweight migration tool when using SQLAlchemy.

- Migration tools allow us to plan, transfer and upgrade resources within databases.

- Alembic allows you to change a SQLALchemy database table after it has been created.

- Currently SQLAlchemy will only create new database tables for us, not enhance any.

### How does Alembic work?

- Alembic provides the creation and invocation of change management scripts.

- This allows you to be able to create migration environments and be able to change data how you like.

- As our application evolves, our database will need to evolve as well.

- Alembic helps us to be able to keep modifying our database to keep up with rapid development requirements.

- We will be suing Alembic on tables that already have data. This allows us to be able to continually create additional content that works within our application.

- In this next section we will learn how we can use Alembic for our project.
