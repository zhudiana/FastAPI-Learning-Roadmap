## Object Oriented Programming

Python is an object oriented language, which allow us to structure our code using **classes** and **objects**. This makes organization and reusability so much better.

### What are classes and objects?

- A **_class_** is a blueprint that defines data (attributes) and behaviours (methods).

- An **_object_** is an instance that uses these defined properties inside the class.

> Creating a class:

```python
# By convention, class names use PascalCase in python
class MyClass:
    num = 2
```

> Creating an object for our class:

```python
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.num)
```

We created an object called _obj_ for the class _MyClass_. Now, the object can access everything defined inside that class.

### `__init()__` Method

- All classes have a built-in method called `__init__()`. This method is excuted when an object is created.

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self):
        print("I am a student")

stud = Student()  # I am a student
```

> `__init__()` must have the _self_ parameter by default. It is a reference to the object that is going to be created or used. Not including `self` or you can name it whatever you want, it will give you an error.

- Creating the object `stud` automatically calls the method `__init__()` and the print statement inside it gets printed. Let's see another example with paramenters:

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, department):
        self.name = name   #This lets us access name with an object
        self.department = department

stud1 = Student("Sara", "Computer Science")
stud2 = Student("Michael", "Telecommunication")
print(stud1.name)               # Sara
print(stud1.department)         # Computer Science
print(stud2.name)               # Michael
print(stud2.department)         # Telecommunication
```

> We can also access methods that are inside a class, using objects.

```python
class Calculate:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def add(self):
        return self.x + self.y

calc = Calculate(4,6)
print(calc.add())
```
