## Data Structures

There are 4 collection data types in python:

- Lists

- Dictionary

- Tuple

- Set

We will only be seeing the first two, but you can find full guide and examples [here.](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)

### 1. Lists

Python lists are built-in data types used to store multiple items in a single variable. We can store values with different data types in a list.

```python
myList = [2, 4, "James", False]
for value in myList:
    print(value)            # 2
                            # 4
                            # James
                            # False
```

- We can change the value of the list using their index.

```python
names = ["Angel", "Leila", "Amen"]
names[2] = "Chris"
print(names)           # ['Angel', 'Leila', 'Chris']
```

### 2. Dictionary

Python dictionaries are used to store data vakues in key:value pair.

```python
my_dict = {
    "name": "Elon",
    "age" : 56,
    "country" : "USA"
}
```

We can access the values in a dictionary using the keys.

```python
print(my_dict["name"])          # Elon
```

- We can change the value of a specific item by using its key name.

```python
my_dict["name"] = "Zuck"
```

- We can also add a new item using a new index key and assign a value to it.

```python
my_dict["married"] = True
```
