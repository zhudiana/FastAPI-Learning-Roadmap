## 🐍 Virtual Environments in Python

A **virtual environment** is an isolated space for your Python project where you can install packages without affecting other projects or the system Python installation.

Why use one?

- Keeps dependencies separate between projects.
- Prevents version conflicts.
- Makes your project easier to share and reproduce.

### **Using `venv` (Built-in)**

**Create a virtual environment:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

- Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- Mac/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Deactivate:

```bash
deactivate
```

📌 Key Tips:

- Always activate your environment before installing packages.

- The environment stores its own pip, so packages are installed only for that project.

- You can have different Python versions for different projects.
