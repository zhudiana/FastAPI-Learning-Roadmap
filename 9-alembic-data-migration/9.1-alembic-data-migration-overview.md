## Alembic

- Alembic is a lightweight migration tool when using SQLAlchemy.

- Migration tools allow us to plan, transfer and upgrade resources within databases.

- Alembic allows you to change a SQLALchemy database table after it has been created.

- Currently SQLAlchemy will only create new database tables for us, not enhance any.

### How does Alembic work?

- Alembic provides the creation and invocation of change management scripts.

- This allows you to be able to create migration environments and be able to change data how you like.

- In this section we will learn how we can use Alembic for our project.
