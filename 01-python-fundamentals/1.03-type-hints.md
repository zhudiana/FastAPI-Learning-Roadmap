## Type Hints

- Type hints are an important feature in Python.

- They let us specify the expected **type** of a variable, function parameter, or return value.

- This helps us with _readability_ and provides an opportunity to _catch errors_ **before runtime** using type checkers like mypy.

  - In plain python, type hints are only hints. they don't enforce anything at run time. We will see what we mean with an example.

#### 1. Variable Type Hints

```python
name: str = "Judy"
age: int = 25
```

> - _name_ is a string.
> - _age_ is an integer.

#### 2. Function Type Hints

> `say_hi()` function expects a string and returns a string (`->str`)

```python
def say_hi(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hi {name}"

print(say_hi("Alex"))  # Hi Alex
print(say_hi(45))      # Hi 45

```

> In the above example, you'd run the code and no error would appear. You might say "we are expecting a string return but passing an integer didn't raise any error". It is because, as we said, _*in plain python, type hints are only hints*_. Unless you install type checker and run it to complain before running, the code will run perfectly. **(In FastAPI, it doesn't just read your type hints, it _enforces_ them automatically at runtime)**
