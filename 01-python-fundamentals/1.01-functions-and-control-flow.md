## ⚙️ Functions and Control Flow

### 1. Conditional Statements

We use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to run different blocks of code based on conditions.

```python
num = 3
if num > 5:
    print("num is above 5")
elif num < 0:
    print("num is negative ")
else:
    print("num is below 5 but positive number") # This will be printed
```

### 2. Python Loops

In Python, we use loop to repeat a block of code multiple times.

#### 2.1. For loop

> We use for loop to iterate over a sequence.

```python
# Loop through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Loop with range (numbers 0 to 4)
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Loop with start, stop, step
for i in range(2, 10, 2):
    print(i)  # 2, 4, 6, 8
```

#### 2.2. While loop

> We use while loop to run while a condition is true.

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### 3. Functions

In Python, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

> We define it once and can call it multiple times.

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello!")

greet()  # We are calling the function here

# By convention, we use snake_case when defining functions in python
def say_hi():
    print("Hi!")
```

> > Function with parameters

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Sara")  # Hello, Sara!
```

> > Function with default parameter

```python
def greet(name="Friend"):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet()           # Hello, Friend
greet("John")     # Hello, John
```

> We can also return values of function, incase we don't want to print something out.

```python
def average(x,y):
    return (x + y) / 2

print(average(2,6))     #4

```
