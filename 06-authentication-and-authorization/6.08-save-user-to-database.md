## Save User to Database

In the previous section, we hashed the user’s password before creating the user object. But so far, the user was **not actually saved** in the database, it was only returned.

In this section, we’ll use a **database dependency** (just like we did with todos) to persist the user data.

### Step 1: Create a DB Dependency

Add the following inside `auth.py` (after the Pydantic model):

```python
def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

db_dependency = Annotated[Session, Depends(get_db)]
```

- `get_db()` opens a new database session, yields it for use, and ensures it is closed afterward.
- `db_dependency` allows us to inject this session into our endpoints without rewriting the same code everywhere.

### Step 2: Update the Auth Endpoint

Now update the `create_user` endpoint to use the dependency and save the user:

```python
@router.post("/auth/", status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
def create_user(db: db_dependency, create_user_request: CreateUserRequest):
    create_user_model = Users(
        email=create_user_request.email,
        username=create_user_request.username,
        first_name=create_user_request.first_name,
        last_name=create_user_request.last_name,
        role=create_user_request.role,
        hashed_password=bcrypt_context.hash(create_user_request.password),
        is_active=True
    )
    db.add(create_user_model)
    db.commit()
```

- `db: db_dependency` → injects the database session.
- `db.add(create_user_model)` → stages the new user for insertion.
- `db.commit()` → saves the new user permanently into the database.

### Testing in Swagger UI

- Send a **POST** request to `/auth/` with user details.
- After a successful request, the new user will be **saved to your database**.
- You can confirm this by opening your `users` table in SQLite and checking the records.
