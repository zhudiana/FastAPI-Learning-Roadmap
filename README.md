# 🚀 FastAPI Learning Roadmap

📚 A complete roadmap to mastering FastAPI — from Python fundamentals to advanced backend development.  
Includes structured notes, curated resources, and example projects.

---

## 📖 Introduction

This repository documents my journey to mastering **FastAPI**, one of the fastest and most modern Python web frameworks.  

It includes:
- **Python fundamentals** needed before starting with FastAPI  
- A **step-by-step learning roadmap** from beginner to expert  
- Curated resources, examples, and practice projects  
- Markdown notes for each topic, perfect for quick revision  

Whether you’re new to backend development or want to deepen your FastAPI skills, this repo can serve as your learning companion.

---

## 🛠 1. Python Fundamentals

Before diving into FastAPI, make sure you are comfortable with:
- Functions & control flow (`if`, `for`, `while`)
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance)
- Type hints
- Data structures: lists, dicts, sets, tuples
- Working in the terminal/command line
- Virtual environments: `venv`, `pipenv`

---

## ⚡ 2. FastAPI Basics
- Installation
- Path & query parameters
- Creating endpoints with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Request & response models using **Pydantic**
- Automatic docs: Swagger UI (`/docs`) and ReDoc (`/redoc`)

---

## 🗄 3. CRUD & Data Modeling
- Build RESTful CRUD APIs
- Use SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) with **SQLAlchemy** or Tortoise ORM
- NoSQL integration (MongoDB with Motor/Beanie)
- Database migrations (Alembic, Tortoise migrations)
- Pydantic schemas for request/response validation

---

## 🔐 4. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- OAuth2 & third-party logins
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

---

## ⚙ 5. Async Programming & Performance
- Master `async`/`await`
- Async-friendly DB drivers (`asyncpg`, AIOHTTP)
- Background tasks
- ASGI, Starlette, and Uvicorn fundamentals

---

## 🔌 6. Dependency Injection & Middleware
- Dependency Injection with `Depends`
- Middleware for logging, CORS, etc.
- Startup & shutdown events (DB connections, background jobs)

---

## 🧪 7. Testing
- Unit and integration testing with **pytest**
- FastAPI’s `TestClient`
- Mocking external services

---

## ☁ 8. Deployment & Scalability
- Containerization with **Docker**
- Deploy to AWS, GCP, Azure, or VPS
- ASGI production servers (Uvicorn, Gunicorn, Daphne)
- Scaling strategies (workers, Kubernetes)

---

## 🎯 9. Advanced Topics
- GraphQL integration (Ariadne, Strawberry)
- Real-time apps with WebSockets
- Caching with Redis
- Background processing with Celery

---

## 🌐 10. Full-Stack Integration
- Combine FastAPI with React, Vue, or Angular
- WebSockets for live updates

---

## 💡 11. Best Practices & Community Tips
> “The most important thing in FastAPI is to know where you potentially can block the event loop — learn what runs in the main thread/event loop versus another (async def vs def).”  
> — r/FastAPI community

> “Keep routes clean. Write business logic in a service layer, data in repositories. Separate schemas/models … easier to test and maintain.”
