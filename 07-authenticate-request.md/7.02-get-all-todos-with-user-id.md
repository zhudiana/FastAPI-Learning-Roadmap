## Get All Todos with User ID

Now we update the **get all todos** endpoint so users only see the todos they created.

```python
@router.get("/", status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
def read_all(user: user_dependency, db: db_dependency):
    return db.query(Todos).filter(Todos.owner_id == user.get("id")).all()
```

- Uses `user_dependency` to get the current user from the JWT.
- Filters todos by `owner_id`, ensuring each user only sees **their own todos**.

You have to be authorized to get the todos with user ID. Therefore you are going to follow the same step on Swagger UI to be authorized first.
