## Delete a Movie

Let's create an endpoint that deletes a movie.

```python
@app.delete("/movies/{movie_id}")
def delete_movies(movie_id: int):
    for i in range(len(MOVIES)):
        if MOVIES[i].id == movie_id:
            MOVIES.pop(i)
            break
```

We can now delete a movie with a specific movie id.
