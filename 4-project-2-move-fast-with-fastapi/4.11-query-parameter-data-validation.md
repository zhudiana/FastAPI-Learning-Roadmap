## Query Parameter Data Validation

We are now going to add a validation to our query parameters. Let's add validation to our query parameters.

We need to import Query from fastapi at the top. We will use Query in the same way as Path. In the `read_movie_by_rating`, we want the rating to be between 0 and 6, and we will validate the query as follows:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Path, Query

@app.get("/movies/")
def read_movie_by_rating(movie_rating: float = Query(gt=0, lt=6)):
    movies_to_return = []
    for movie in MOVIES:
        if movie.rating == movie_rating:
            movies_to_return.append(movie)
    return movies_to_return
```

We will add a validation to `read_movie_by_released_year` as well. We want the query to be greater than 1980 and less than 2025.

```python
@app.get("/movies/released_year/")
def read_movie_by_released_year(released_date: int = Query(gt=1980, lt=2025)):
    movie_to_return = []
    for movie in MOVIES:
        if movie.released_year == released_date:
            movie_to_return.append(movie)
    return movie_to_return
```
