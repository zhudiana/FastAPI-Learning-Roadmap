## Path Parameter Data Validation

Currently on out Movie 2 projects, we have validation on our pydantics `MovieRequest`. But we don't have any validation on each endpoint outside of the pydantics requests. For example:

```python
@app.get("/movies/{movie_id}")
def read_movie(movie_id: int):
    for movie in MOVIES:
        if movie.id == movie_id:
            return movie
```

In this endpoint, we are not returning anything if a movie does not exist. And also, is there any way we can validate `movie_id` so that the `movie_id` must be a positive integer or within a certain limit of numbers?

We can use `Path` by importing it from fastapi to validate `movie_id` as follows:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Path

@app.get("/movies/{movie_id}")
def read_movie(movie_id: int = Path(gt=0)):
    for movie in MOVIES:
        if movie.id == movie_id:
            return movie
```

> Now, if you search a movie with an id less than 0, you will get 422 error.

In this way, we have ensured that our path has validation. So when a user types in a path parameter for our application, we are validating if the path parameter is a valid path parameter before we run our application.
