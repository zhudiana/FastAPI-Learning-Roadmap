## Update a Movie

Let's create an endpoint that updates a movie.

```python
@app.put("/movies/update-movies")
def update_movies(movies: MovieRequest):
    for i in range(len(MOVIES)):
        if MOVIES[i].id == movies.id:
            MOVIES[i]= movies
```

One thing you will notice using this end point is, when you add a movie in the request body to update, if you type in the `id=1000` and try to update the movie, you will get status code `200` even though it didn't do anything. We will be covering how to handle this kind of exceptions and errors in our application.
