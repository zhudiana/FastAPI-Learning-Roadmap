## Pydantics and Data Validation

- `Pydantics` is a python library that is used for data modeling, data parsing and has efficient error handling.

- It is commonly used for data validation and how to handle data coming to our FastAPI application.

We will be implementing Pydantics into our project by:

- creating a different request model for data validation.

- adding a `Field` data validation on each variable/element.

```python
class MovieRequest(BaseModel):
    id: int
    title: str = Field(min_length=3)
    director: str = Field(min_length=1)
    genre: str = Field(min_length=1, max_length=5)
    rating: int = Field(gt=0, lt=5)
```

In the above example, you can see that we used `BaseModel`. `BaseModel` is the _pydantics model_ which gives us more functionality on data validation. Therefore, `MovieRequest` is a _pydantics model request_.

- We will convert this pydantics request model into a Movie.

```python
@app.post("/create-movie")
def create_movie(movie_request: MovieRequest):
    new_movie = Movie(**movie_request.model_dump())
    MOVIES.append(new_movie)
```

We used `MovieRequest`, our pydantics model into our post request when we are setting `movie_request` type as `MovieRequest` model.

> The `**` operator in the `Movie()` will pass the key-value from `MovieRequest()` to `Movie()` constructor.

`Movie(\*\*movie_request.model_dump())` : We are just converting the request to Movie object.
