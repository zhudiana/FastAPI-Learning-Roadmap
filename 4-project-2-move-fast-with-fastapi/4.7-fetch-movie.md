## Fetch Movie

### 1. Fetch movie by `id`

Let's create an endpoint that fetches a movie by an id.

```python
@app.get("/movies/{movie_id}")
def read_movie(movie_id: int):
    for movie in MOVIES:
        if movie.id == movie_id:
            return movie
```

This will return the movie with the specific id you provided.

### 2. Fetch movie by `rating`

Let's create an endpoint that fetches movies by a rating.

```python
@app.get("/movies/")
def read_movie_by_rating(movie_rating: float):    # rating type is float
    movies_to_return = []
    for movie in MOVIES:
        if movie.rating == movie_rating:
            movies_to_return.append(movie)
    return movies_to_return
```

This will fetch movies by their rating. We used a `movies_to_return` list here because there might be more than 1 movies with the same rating.
