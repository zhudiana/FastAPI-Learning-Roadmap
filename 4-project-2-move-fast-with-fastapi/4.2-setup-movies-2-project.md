## Setup Movies 2 Project

Create a python file called movies2 or any name you want and add a simple get request as follows:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

MOVIES = []

@app.get("/movies")
def read_all_movies():
    return MOVIES
```

Now, as I mentioned before, we are going to be using a python object from a Movie class. so let's create a class called Movies inside our python file.
