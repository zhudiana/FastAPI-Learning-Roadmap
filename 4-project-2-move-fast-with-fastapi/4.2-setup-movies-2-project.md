## Setup Movies 2 Project

Create a python file called movies2 or any name you want and add a simple get request as follows:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

MOVIES = []

@app.get("/movies")
def read_all_movies():
    return MOVIES
```

Now, as I mentioned before, we are going to be using a python object from a Movie class. So let's create a class called `Movies` inside our python file.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

class Movie:
    id: int
    title: str
    director: str
    genre: str
    rating: int

    def __init__(self, id, title, director, genre, rating):
        self.id = id
        self.title = title
        self.director = director
        self.genre = genre
        self.rating = rating

MOVIES = [
    Movie(1, 'Inception', 'Christopher Nolan', 'Sci-Fi', 4.8),
    Movie(2, 'The Godfather', 'Francis Ford Coppola', 'Crime', 4.7),
    Movie(3, 'Spirited Away', 'Hayao Miyazaki', 'Animation', 4.8),
    Movie(4, 'Parasite', 'Bong Joon-ho', 'Thriller', 4.8),
    Movie(5, 'Pulp Fiction', 'Quentin Tarantino', 'Drama', 4.5),
]

@app.get("/movies")
def read_all_movies():
    return MOVIES
```

The Movie class defines the properties of a movie, and its **init**() method runs automatically whenever a new Movie object is created, initializing the object with the given values.

Run the code and go to the swagger UI. In the `/movies` endpoint, you will see all the movies listed in the response body
