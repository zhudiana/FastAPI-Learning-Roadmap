## Creating endpoints with HTTP methods in FastAPI

FastAPI makes it easy to define different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for you [API](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/) endpoints. You use [python decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/#functions-as-return-values) on top of your functions to tell FastAPI which method and path they should respond to.

### 1. GET

- Used to retrieve data from the server.

- You pass parameters either in the [path]() or as [query parameters]().

- Should not change anything on the server (read-only).
