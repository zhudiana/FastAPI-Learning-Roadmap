## FastAPI Overview

- FastAPI is a Python web-framework for buidling modern APIs. It is fast in:

  - performance &

  - development

- FastAPI reduces bugs by using [Python type hints](https://github.com/zhudiana/FastAPI-Learning-Roadmap/blob/main/1-python-fundamentals/1.3-type-hints.md) for automatic data validation and editor autocompletion. This ensures requests match the expected format before reaching your code.

- FastAPI is _fast_ and _easy to use_, combining high performance with simple, intuitive syntax for building APIs quickly.

- FastAPI is _robust_ and _production-ready_ within minutes, with automatic and dynamic documentation that makes testing and integration effortless.

- FastAPI follows modern development _standards_, using OpenAPI and JSON Schema for API documentation and data validation.

```
   Web Page  ──(Request)──▶  FastAPI Server  ──(Process Data)──▶  Database
            ◀─(Response with JSON)─────────
```

FastAPI acts as the backend for your web page, ensuring users receive _correct_, _secure_, and _validated data_ to interact with.
